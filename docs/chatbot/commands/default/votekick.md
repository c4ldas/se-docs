# !votekick

## Overview

The `!votekick` command initiates a community vote to temporarily remove a user from the chat. This feature allows viewers to participate in chat moderation by voting on whether a potentially disruptive user should be kicked.

## Usage

```
!votekick <username> [duration]
```

## Examples

1. Start a votekick for user "chatty_person" with the default duration:
```
!votekick chatty_person
```

2. Start a votekick for user "noisy_viewer" with a custom duration of 5 minutes:
```
!votekick noisy_viewer 5m
```

## Parameters

- `<username>`: The name of the user to be potentially kicked (required)
- `[duration]`: The length of time for the voting period (optional)
  - If not specified, uses the default duration set in the module configuration
  - Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)

## Configuration

- Minimum Votes: Specify the minimum number of votes required for a valid votekick
- Vote Threshold: Define the percentage of positive votes needed for the votekick to pass
- Timeout Duration: Set how long the user will be timed out if the vote passes
