# !contest

## Overview

The `!contest` command is a powerful tool in the StreamElements chatbot that allows streamers and viewers to quickly get information about the currently active contest. This command is part of the Contest module and helps increase viewer engagement by providing easy access to ongoing contest details.

## Usage

To use the `!contest` command, simply type it in the chat:

```
!contest
```

This command doesn't require any additional arguments or parameters.

## Examples

### Example 1: Active Contest

When there's an active contest running:

```
User: !contest
Chatbot: @User, the current contest is "Will I win the next game?". You can !bet for win, lose. Betting ends in 4 mins 55 secs
```

### Example 2: No Active Contest

When there's no active contest:

```
User: !contest
Chatbot: @User, there is no active contest.
```

## Customization

While the `!contest` command itself cannot be customized, you can customize the contest settings, such as:

- Contest duration
- Betting options
- Minimum and maximum bet amounts

These settings can be adjusted in the StreamElements dashboard under the Loyalty settings.
