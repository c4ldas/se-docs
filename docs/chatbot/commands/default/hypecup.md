## Overview

The `!hypecup` command is used to manage the HypeCup overlay on your Twitch stream. It allows you to clear the overlay when needed, providing better control over your stream's visual elements.

## Usage

To use the `!hypecup` command, type it in chat followed by the `clear` parameter:

1. Clearing the HypeCup overlay:

   ```

2. Attempting to use the command without the `clear` parameter:

   ```
   
   Output:
   ```
   @YourUsername, Usage: !hypecup clear
   ```
