The `!roulette` command allows viewers to participate in a roulette game, betting their channel points for a chance to win more. This command is part of the StreamElements chatbot's loyalty system and can add an exciting, interactive element to your stream.

## Usage

```
!roulette <bet>
```

The `<bet>` parameter is required and represents the number of points the user wants to wager.
